To reproduce the results presented in this analysis, start by running the wrangling script located in the code directory. This script will load the original dataset, perform all required data cleaning and transformations, and save the cleaned datasets into the data directory for use in the analysis. Note that the data is from 2007-2018.

After running the wrangling script, execute the final-report.qmd file in the home directory and the supplementary.qmd file in the docs directory. These files will generate the final report along with all supplementary graphs and tables.
